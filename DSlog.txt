The device supports all sample rates between the dwMinSecondarySampleRate and dwMaxSecondarySampleRate member values. Typically, this means that the actual output rate will be within +/- 10 hertz (Hz) of the requested frequency.
The device supports primary sound buffers with 16-bit samples.  
The device supports primary buffers with 8-bit samples.  
The device supports monophonic primary buffers.  
The device supports stereo primary buffers.  
The device supports hardware-mixed secondary sound buffers with 16-bit samples.  
The device supports hardware-mixed secondary buffers with 8-bit samples.  
The device supports hardware-mixed monophonic secondary buffers.  
The device supports hardware-mixed stereo secondary buffers
